                    <p>There has been an awakening, have you felt it? Star Wars 
                        is back! The third highest grossing movie of all time! 
                        With J.J. Abrams the director of the new Star Trek movies,
                        Super 8 and more this movie is Star Wars which most 
                        everybody knows and enjoys. With Harrison Ford and some 
                        other actors from the classic films, this movie also 
                        brings in new actors which I think did a great job in 
                        this movie. The visuals were great with great imaging 
                        and conception put into the new locations and in other 
                        pieces of the movie like the costumes and all. It was 
                        awesome and made me feel like a was a little kid again, 
                        like the first time I watched Star Wars. A lot of people
                        have been waiting for this day, and now it has come, the
                        Force definitely has, awakened.</p>

                <h4>Owen Vandevelde</h4>
                <p>Last December, the world was blessed by another addition to 
                    the Star Wars collection of movies, and this time, the movie
                    was really damn good.  J.J. Abrams is an excellent director 
                    and was credited with many other visually stunning films.  
                    The flow of the movie was smooth and it was never boring.  
                    The casting for the new roles was also great.  Rey, Daisy 
                    Ridley, did spectacular, and is a very good main character. 
                    The only disappointment the movie had was the development of
                    Adam Driver’s character, Kylo Ren.  He wasn’t that bad, and 
                    looked like how a Sith should look, from the outside.  Under
                    the mask is a confused boy in his mid 20’s struggling with an
                    identity crisis. He doesn’t know if the path he has chosen is
                    right.  I believe that this movie brought Star Wars back with
                    all its might and glory and I can’t wait for the next 
                    installment in the series.
