" + form.firstName.value + " was " + form.age.value + " years old and lived on a " + form.city.value + ", " + form.state.value + ".  While on their shift for germ patrol " + pet + " jumped out from behind a " + form.plant.value + " and tackled " + form.firstName.value + " to the ground.  But just when " + heShe + " was about to let out a scream for help, " + form.firstName.value + " realized that the " + pet + " was only taking it's soul " + hisHer + " to brign them into a sickening reality.  At that moment, " + form.firstName.value + " decided to run but, it was too late " + pet + " chased it and brought it into a mid-reality trance, part demon world part real world..  And on the way home " + heShe + " saw everything " + hisHer + " had created  " + pet + " 'transformed everything into'" + form.friend.value + ".''  When " + form.firstName.value + " and " + hisHer + " new existance finally got home, guess who was standing on the front porch?  That's right, it was " + form.firstName.value + "'s friend, " + form.mom.value + ".  but it wasn't that dear friend, it was a monster, a demon,  " + pet + " following " + form.firstName.value + " into the yard!  ''I'll suck your soul?'' shouted " + form.mom.value + ".  ''It's attacking me that " + pet + ",'' answered " + form.firstName.value + ".  ''Dah, I can see that, " + form.firstName.value + ", but why do you ask me for help, I will just take your soul'' said " + form.mom.value + ".  ''It's my new existance I am trapped'' answered " + form.firstName.value +".  ''Oh you think so do you?'' remarked " + form.mom.value + ".  ''I wouldn't get your hopes up. You know how the mayor eats people like you for breakfast " + pet + "s.  I will call the mayor and it will consume all you know and care about''  And with that " + form.firstName.value + " grabbed " + form.friend.value + " by the scruff of the neck and led " + hisHer + " new nightmarish creature into the house--and " + heShe + " burned it " + hisHer + " mayor was probably going to consume all their optimism to pessimism in a sickening existance.  Once in the house, " + form.firstName.value + " and the burned remains of " + form.friend.value + " , that is until the mayor floated into the house and said your existance is mine " + form.firstName.value + "'s favorite fictional character appeared ''"+ form.tv.value + ",'' and attacked.  At that point existance was sickening " + form.firstName.value + " forgot all about life, and death and happiness" + form.friend.value + " disappeared form their memory and was gone.  That is until half way through the fight between the ''" + form.tv.value + ",'' when " + form.firstName.value + " was brought back to reality when " + heShe + " heard " + hisHer + " father shout, ''" + form.cuss.value + "!!  " + form.firstName.value + "! Get your filthy little sickening existance in the mayors ready kitchen " + form.room.value + "...NOW!!''  With that " + form.firstName.value + " rushed into the " + form.room.value + " to end their own existance.  When " + heShe + " entered the " + form.room.value + ", there stood " + hisHer + " enemy, " + form.dad.value + ", pointing toward the " + form.furn.value + ".  ''Let's dance'' asked " + hisHer + " worst celebrity  Then, as " + form.firstName.value + " followed " + hisHer + " evils's finger to where it was pointing, " + heShe + " instantly knew what " + hisHer + " evil man was so powerful obssesed about.  There, smack dab in the middle of the " + form.furn.value + ", a pile " + form.animal.value + " burning stuff " + heShe + " hand used it to power up  ''They fought for hours upon hours,'' said " + form.dad.value + ".  ''But you had better be ready to die  And you had better get rid of whaterver makes your soul happy!''  Well, knowing " + hisHer + " father as well as " + heShe + " did, " + form.firstName.value + " knew there was no sense even asking " + hisHer + " father if " + heShe + " could keep " + form.friend.value + " for a pet.  So without hesitation, " + form.firstName.value + " set out to find where " + form.friend.value + " was hiding.  After a few minutes of looking, " + form.firstName.value + " discovered " + form.friend.value + " crouched beneath the table that " + form.firstName.value + " did " + hisHer + " " + form.hobby.value + " on.  ''Come on, " + form.friend.value + ", it's time to find you a new home.  And hey, don't look at me that way, I'm not the one who did the dirty deed on the " + form.furn.value + "!'' scolded " + form.firstName.value + ".  ''Thanks to you I'll never get to have my own pet " + form.animal.value + "!!  And with that " + form.firstName.value + " led " + form.friend.value + " out of the house and down to the local " + form.store.value + ".  They had a pet section and " + form.firstName.value + " knew the owner would find " + form.friend.value + " a good home.  So after saying good-bye to " + form.friend.value + ", and thanking the owner of " + form.store.value + ", " + form.firstName.value + " walked backed home and attempted to dround " + hisHer + " sorrows by slamming down a half dozen " + form.drink.value + "s.  But " + form.firstName.value + "'s pitty party came to an abrupt end when " + hisHer + " father reminded " + himHer + " about the mess " + heShe + " had neglected to clean up.  And low and behold, midway through the clean-up, " + form.firstName.value + " suddenly became thankful that someone else was going to have to do it from now on.  The End.");
