                    <p>In Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice
                    which came out a while ago, we saw Ben Affleck as Batman and 
                    Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. Though I have only seen a few 
                    other actors be Batman, and I have not seen any other movies 
                    with Ben Affleck in them, I think Ben Affleck did a pretty good 
                    job playing Batman, he was an older dude who had been Batman for
                    quite sometime and just locking up criminals isn’t enough for him
                    anymore. Though Ben Affleck pretty much just plays Batman the 
                    whole time, even without the mask he still portrays a kind of 
                    grouchy character and not smooth ladies man Bruce Wayne, he 
                    wasn’t bad. In Now You See Me Jesse Eisenberg did a great job 
                    playing a lead role, and in this film I don’t think he did as 
                    good as he did in Now You See Me, he had an interesting idea for
                    Lex Luthor, making him almost more like the Joker than classic 
                    bald mastermind Lex Luthor. This movie is part of a set up for 
                    the Justice League movie which I think should be interesting 
                    because their have been quite a few animated Justice Leagues but
                    not really any live action ones.Though it was long and a bit 
                    confusing in the addition that is like 30 minutes longer(Yaah!!!)
                    I think it will be interesting to see what they took out. There 
                    are a lot of negative things I could say about this movie but 
                    also a great highpoint in this movie and even though it was only
                    for a moment, there was Neil deGrasse Tyson which is enough for 
                    me to want to see this movie.</p>

                <p>Okay, first of all, this movie wasn’t as
                    bad as people say but it still was a wreck.  It had so much 
                    potential to be a epic fight and show the formation of the 
                    Justice League but instead it was just a 2 and a half hour set 
                    up for the next movie, “Justice League”.  It’s story made no sense,
                    like why Batman was inclined to fight Superman, and why Batman 
                    didn’t kill Superman.  Their mom had the same name!  What the 
                    hell.  Lex Luthor was basically the Joker, not the tech savvy 
                    mastermind in the comics.  Speaking of comics, why was Doomsday 
                    there?  I understand Lex’s intentions to create Doomsday but he 
                    never appeared in the original comic and really didn’t add to the
                    plot.  He just gave them a reason to stop fighting each other 
                    and fight together.  Wonder Woman also didn’t add to the story 
                    either.  The best part of the movie was getting to see Flash, 
                    Aquaman, and Cyborg or the vision of the future where Superman 
                    is the leader.  Batman looked really cool in that desert outfit.
