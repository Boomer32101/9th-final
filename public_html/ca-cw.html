                    <p> 
                        This May Captain America: Civil War entered theaters and
                        again like in Batman vs Superman : Dawn of Justice, the 
                        heroes become locked in a struggle against one another. 
                        I thought this movie did a better job making a movie 
                        about heroes fighting each other than Batman vs Superman
                        . Though the ethics on both side have some flaws, you 
                        are pretty much following Captain America on this opposed
                        to Batman vs Superman where you mostly follow Batman but
                        Superman has more reason than Batman and the movie builds
                        up to something that ends up becoming just a petty 
                        quarrel when Doomsday comes. While in Captain America: 
                        Civil War the battle of Captain America vs Iron Man is 
                        the main plot of the movie with no third power too great
                        to change the plot. Both Batman vs Superman and Civil War
                        were long movies but Civil War progressed more smoothly 
                        and the movie did not feel like it dragged on like in 
                        Batman vs Superman. In the past few years Disney has made
                        a great film empire out of the Marvel movies and are 
                        doing a great job. I find the idea of all these movies 
                        being interconnected in the same storyline unique and 
                        cool. They did a good job introducing the Black Panther 
                        who I think has some great potential in future Marvel 
                        movies and Spider-man as well had a good introduction 
                        in this movie and I think this fun, young version of 
                        Peter Parker has great potential. Ant-Man like in his 
                        own movie brought humor into the movie while the main 
                        characters still got to shine and do their thing. The 
                        fact that the sides weren’t completely clear allowed some
                        characters to have some inter conflicts and shifting of 
                        sides. Overall it was a pretty good movie and I think 
                        that you should go see it and bring your family too.

                <p>
                    Captain America: Civil War hit theaters May 6th, and was 
                    great, but it still had some flaws. First of all, it didn’t
                    follow the Civil War comic that much,  probably because they
                    didn’t have nearly as many characters as in the comic.  However, 
                    This meant no inter-dimensional prison, no Captain America 
                    dying, no Thor clone, and no Spider-Man publicly revealing his 
                    identity.  This doesn’t make the movie bad, but it is annoying
                    to know that there is two different stories.  Another 
                    difference is that Baron Zemo drives the conflict by framing
                    Bucky Barnes (The Winter Soldier) unlike the idea of going 
                    public because of a disaster like in the comic.  With all 
                    these differences, the movies was still good, it had a solid
                    plot and the dialog was funny and entertaining.  It was 
                    obviously better than it’s competition Batman V Superman and
                    I would recommend that you see this movie while still in 
                    theaters.
