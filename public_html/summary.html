                    <h4>Sean Miller</h4>
                    <p>Sean Dow Miller is a kid from PHS, and was in a dance 
                        battle which got thousands of views on Perfect Videos 
                        and got on World Star Hip Hop. He enjoys rap-battling his
                        tennis opponents and making insane games in his coding 
                        class. He is a unique individual that has many unique 
                        skills. His mission is to give the world knowledge on 
                        movies, comics and more. While telling the kids of the 
                        world of this movie is appropriate for them. He also 
                        wants to save or not save people money by telling them 
                        if they should watch a movie. This is a Mission 
                        Impossible: Cinema Nation. Sean Miller says”Now I am 
                        gonna make a rap, My name is Sean Miller, my raps are 
                        fire, if you say it’s not true, then you are a liar. When
                        it comes to pure skill no one is ranked higher. My rhymes
                        burn like the sun, it’s official this rap battle is 
                        already won. You think you’re so skilled but you’re not, 
                        your like the titanic you are gonna crash into the ice 
                        so you better panic. My rhymes are like fine wine from 
                        the finest glasses, my rhymes affect people in the 
                        population masses. I was born with this skill, don’t 
                        need no rhyming classes. When something comes at me it 
                        never passes. I am Sean, I’ll beat you so fast  that in 
                        five seconds you will be gone. I am the king, I got lots
                        a bling, cha ching.” </p>
