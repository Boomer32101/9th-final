                    <h4>Sean Miller</h4>
                    <p>Sean Dow Miller is a kid from PHS, and was in a dance 
                        battle which got thousands of views on Perfect Videos 
                        and got on World Star Hip Hop. He enjoys rap-battling his
                        tennis opponents and making insane games in his coding 
                        class. He is a unique individual that has many unique 
                        skills. His mission is to give the world knowledge on 
                        movies, comics and more. While telling the kids of the 
                        world of this movie is appropriate for them. He also 
                        wants to save or not save people money by telling them 
                        if they should watch a movie. This is a Mission 
                        Impossible: Cinema Nation. Sean Miller says”Now I am 
                        gonna make a rap, My name is Sean Miller, my raps are 
                        fire, if you say it’s not true, then you are a liar. When
                        it comes to pure skill no one is ranked higher. My rhymes
                        burn like the sun, it’s official this rap battle is 
                        already won. You think you’re so skilled but you’re not, 
                        your like the titanic you are gonna crash into the ice 
                        so you better panic. My rhymes are like fine wine from 
                        the finest glasses, my rhymes affect people in the 
                        population masses. I was born with this skill, don’t 
                        need no rhyming classes. When something comes at me it 
                        never passes. I am Sean, I’ll beat you so fast  that in 
                        five seconds you will be gone. I am the king, I got lots
                        a bling, cha ching.” </p>

                    <h4>Owen Vandevelde</h4>
                    <p>Owen has been a critic since birth. He has criticized 
                        everything from John’s website to arrow season 3. He 
                        watches a lot of critics to build up his critic xp. 
                        From the Cinemasins to Johntron he has seen it all. One 
                        of his  favorite movies is Mad Max: Fury Road. He plays 
                        soccer to relieve himself of this cancerous world. He is
                        so much of a critic he actually has his own series of 
                        iFunnys called Post Gave Me Cancer with spiderman in a 
                        bed. He loves old cartoon spiderman memes. He spends his
                        free time using the photoshop making dank memes. His 
                        favorite game on steam is broforce and he is a League of
                        Legends fanatic. His favorite yugioh deck is blackwings,
                        I mean that is like the only deck you only see him use. 
                        He made a morphtronic deck which he sold for evotiles 
                        which he never uses. Owen claims he uses yosenjus but 
                        they are just a lie and spirits are way better. Owen is
                        very, very proud of his Blaize Pascal photoshop. After 
                        Owen gets his haircut he looks like Steven Amell and 
                        when he lets his hair grows out he looks like a hobo. 
                        Owen likes playing smash and always plays Pacman and 
                        DeeDeeDee. He is buff because he goes to crossfit and 
                        does G3. Owen joined the app academy so one day he can 
                        make coding great again and learn how to make his own 
                        enter the gungeon.
